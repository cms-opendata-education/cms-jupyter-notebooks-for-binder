# Analyse CMS Open Data in Jupyter Notebooks using Binder

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks reading CMS open data directly from the [CERN Open Data](http://opendata.cern.ch) portal, which can be quickly launched in Binder.

Press this button below to launch Binder and get to work. The main beef is in the file named "Open Data with CMS - outreach and education".
