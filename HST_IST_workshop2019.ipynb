    "In this exercise we will learn how to use Python-programming to plot a histogram and analyse it. We use a dataset collected by the CMS detector in 2011 [1]. The data consists of such events, where two muons were created in a collision. We want to plot a histogram of the invariant mass of the two muons created in the collision. Events with specific criteria [2] have been selected in the CSV file _Ymumu_\\__Run2011A.csv_ which we are using.\n",

To gain a better understanding of the code, read the comment lines carefully.\n",

Note that we will use a total of 500 bins in the histogram, so it is hard to see separate bins because there are so many of them.
